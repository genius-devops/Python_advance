# Do you know what Mississippi is? Well, it's the name of one of the states and rivers in the United States. The Mississippi River is about 2,340 miles long, which makes it the second longest river in the United States (the longest being the Missouri River). It's so long that a single drop of water needs 90 days to travel its entire length!
#
# The word Mississippi is also used for a slightly different purpose: to count mississippily.
#
# If you're not familiar with the phrase, we're here to explain to you what it means: it's used to count seconds.
#
# The idea behind it is that adding the word Mississippi to a number when counting seconds aloud makes them sound closer to clock-time, and therefore "one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi" will take approximately an actual three seconds of time! It's often used by children playing hide-and-seek to make sure the seeker does an honest count.
#
# Your task is very simple here: write a program that uses a for loop to "count mississippily" to five. Having counted to five, the program should print to the screen the final message "Ready or not, here I come!"

# 1. Python supports the following logical operators:
#
# and â†’ if both operands are true, the condition is true, e.g., (True and True) is True,
# or â†’ if any of the operands are true, the condition is true, e.g., (True or False) is True,
# not â†’ returns false if the result is true, and returns true if the result is false, e.g., not True is False.
# 2. You can use bitwise operators to manipulate single bits of data. The following sample data:
#
# x = 15, which is 0000 1111 in binary,
# y = 16, which is 0001 0000 in binary.
# will be used to illustrate the meaning of bitwise operators in Python. Analyze the examples below:
#
# & does a bitwise and, e.g., x & y = 0, which is 0000 0000 in binary,
# | does a bitwise or, e.g., x | y = 31, which is 0001 1111 in binary,
# Ëœ  does a bitwise not, e.g., Ëœ x = 240*, which is 1111 0000 in binary,
# ^ does a bitwise xor, e.g., x ^ y = 31, which is 0001 1111 in binary,
# >> does a bitwise right shift, e.g., y >> 1 = 8, which is 0000 1000 in binary,
# << does a bitwise left shift, e.g., y << 3 = , which is 1000 0000 in binary.
# * -16 (decimal from signed 2's complement) -- read more about the Two's complement operation.
